# Computational Analysis of Single Cell Data
This repository contains the materials for the course on Computational Analysis of Single Cell Data at Heidelberg university for the DSCB major.

## Preparations
1. Make sure you are in the DSCB Mattermost channel "single-cell-course-2025". (Use "Add channel" > "Browse channels" to find it).

2. For the course you need to bring a laptop with R (version 4.4) and RStudio installed. Go back to the instructions on the [Data Analysis course homepage](https://github.com/velten-group/data-analysis-course) if you need to re-install or update R or RStudio.

3. Once you have installed R and RStudio, please go to the [exercises](exercises/) page. There you will find one exercise (01_welcome.Rmd) to verify that everyone has a working R installation setup before the course and is able to work with packages from [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/). Knit this file and hand it in via Mattermost.

4. SignUp for [GitHub](https://github.com/) and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Go through “Create a Tutorial Repo”. We will introduce Git in more detail on the first day of the course (Note: *If you are familiar with GitHub and git and prefer to use the command line, no need to install GitHub Desktop*) 

:point_right: Please send your GitHub name and the html of the 01_welcome.Rmd exercise to Britta Velten via Mattermost before the course starts (before April 22).


If you encounter any problems, please get help via the Mattermost channel.
